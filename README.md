# Pokedevs Project

## Overview

The Pokedevs Project is a web application that showcases a selection of Pok√©mon-like characters (Pokedevs). It allows users to interact with character cards, displaying details and changing the active selection. This project was created to enhance my understanding of web development, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Cards**: Users can click on different Pokedev characters to view detailed information in a card format.
- **Dynamic Class Management**: The project uses JavaScript to manage the active state of cards, ensuring only one card is displayed at a time.
- **Stylish Interface**: Utilizes modern CSS techniques for layout and styling, including flexbox, media queries, and backdrop filters for a visually appealing design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, including responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content management.

## Inspiration

This project was developed while following a live stream by **Dev Em Dobro**, a platform that provides valuable tutorials and insights into web development. The live session inspired many of the techniques and functionalities implemented in this project. I encourage anyone interested in web development to check out their content for further learning!
